## Chapter 4: Judgmental forecast
When this forecast use to be used: 
- Lack of historical data,
- new products are launched
- new competitors enter to the market,
- completely new and unique market conditions

## Chapter 5: Regression Models
Concepts:
- Forecast variable y, dependent pr explained variable,
- Predictor variable x: regressors, independent or explanatory variables.

### Simple models
Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression
- In this case we have multiple predictors and the coefficients measure the *marginal effects* of the predictor variables.

To estimate the coefficients we use least squares principles minimising the sum of the squared errors. This is called least squares estimation.

### Goodness of fit

R²: Coefficient of determination, the square of the correlation between the observed y values and the predicted y values. It reflects the proportion of variation in the forecast variable that is accounted for (or explained) by the regression model. 
0 above R² above 1, if the predictions are close to the actual values R² will be closer to 1, if not it will be closer to 0.

### Standard error of the regression
