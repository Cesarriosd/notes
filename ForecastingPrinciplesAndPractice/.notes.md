## Chapter 5: Regression Models
Concepts:

- Predictor variable x: regressors, independent or explanatory variables.

### Simple models
Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression
- In this case we have multiple predictors and the coefficients measure the *marginal effects* of the predictor variables.

To estimate the coefficients we use least squares principles minimising the sum of the squared errors. This is called least squares estimation.
